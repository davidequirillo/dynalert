# TODO

- The user opens the mobile application for the first time and the disclaimer/terms of use page appears in a page. It must be accepted to go on (it appears only the first time, after that the user acceptance is stored).

- After that, a login page appears. In the login page there is a button to change the server. There is also a link to reset password, and a link to register the account (registration api).

- Implement the registration page

- Implement the reset password function (it sends an activation code to the user)

- Implement the activation procedure (to complete user registration)

- Implement Login procedure (details to define, under construction).

- A simple testing system (to test the server and the client. For example a script that calls the sub-test systems, one for the server, and one for the client)

- After the login, the application listen continuously for push notifications (alarms coming from the server)

- Alarm page: this is the main page (the home page, after login). It has only 1 text field (similar to a textarea). It's the "description" field, "OK" button, and "Reset" button. It has an attachment button and a "camera" button (respectively to attach a file or to make a photo).
