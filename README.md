*"Together we are stronger"*

Dinalert is a network alert manager: when it receives an alert from a connected client (mostly a mobile device), it takes some decisions based on alert description, and then it sends a push notification to all geolocalized nearby clients.
Clients can receive different notification instructions based on user account type (citizen, military, police, firemen, civil protection).

This system can be largely extended to manage virtually all alert types, in order to have a security defensive system that works 360 degrees, giving specific real-time instructions to user groups when an alert happens, receiving signals from network sensors (for example, smoke or meteo sensors), eventually sending active commands to some devices (patrol drones, or others), to help and lead peoples to safe zones, and working in a parallel way too, if many alert happen at the same time. Ideally the system could use artificial intelligence to optimize the active response to events.
